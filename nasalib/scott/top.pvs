%
% This library defines the Scott Topology, and shows that continuous functions
% are increasing and lub-preserving; and -- under pointwise-ordering -- also
% form a Scott Topology.
%
% The main reason Computer Scientists are interested is that it constitutes a
% general foundation on which to build the fixpoint theory needed for the
% semantics of loops or recursion.
