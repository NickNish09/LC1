% Generalized Power function (without ln/exp)
%
%     Author: David Lester, Manchester University & NIA
%
%     Version 1.0            19/08/08   Initial version (DRL)
%
% This library provides Roots, Powers and Generalized Logs
%
% The (achieved) aim is to avoid using all libraries except those in
% the standard prelude. Hooks are provided so that the power function
% along with root and log can be shown to be continuous (over
% suitable domains), but no continuity libraries have been used to
% construct this library, meaning that it is built directly onto the
% standard SRI prelude.
%
% Features include:
% 
% By INCLUDING root, you can have statements like:
%
%   root(8,3) = 2
%
% By INCLUDING real_expt, you can have statements like:
%
%   8^(1/3) = 2
%
% BY INCLUDING log, you can have statements like:
%
%   log(2)(8) = 3 /* = ln(8)/ln(2) */
