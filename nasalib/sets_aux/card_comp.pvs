%  Compare set cardinalities for any two sets, whether finite or infinite.
%  See cardinal.pvs for a cardinality(S) function that operates on any
%  set, whether finite or infinite, using these definitions as a basis.
%
%  We have to take great care with empty sets.  The basic problem is that
%  there is NO function from a nonempty domain to an empty range.  This is
%  why card_lt and card_ge deal with functions that are "reversed" from
%  those in the other definitions, so that we can talk about injective
%  functions (which exist from empty domains to nonempty ranges) instead
%  of surjective functions (which do not exist from nonempty domains to
%  empty ranges).
