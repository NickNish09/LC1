orthogonality: Formalizes confluence of orhtogonal TRSs importing the 
               PVS theory for Term Rewriting and Abstract Reduction Systems trs
               available at NASA LaRC PVS libraries. This formalization follows
               closely analytical proofs as the one presented in Baader & Nipkow's
               famous textbook "Term Rewriting and All That" and uses the 
               Parallel Moves Lemma.
