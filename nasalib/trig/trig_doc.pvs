% Much of the foundational development was based on 
% 
%     Abramovitz and Stegun, "Handbook of Mathematical Functions" Dover.
%     9th Edition (1972).
% 
% Approach:
% 
% (1) Define atan as an integral:  
% 
%	  atan(x) = Integral(0, x, (LAMBDA (x:real):1/(1+x*x)))  %  4.4.3
% 
% 
% (2) Define atan, as having the same values as atan_value, but with
%     source (-pi/2,pi/2).
% 
% (3) Prove it's a bijection.
% 
% (4) Define asin and acos, proving that they are bijections also:
% 
%	  asin(x:real_abs_le1): real_abs_le_pi2 =
%	     IF x = -1 THEN -pi/2 ELSIF x < 1 
%	     THEN atan(x/sqrt(1-x*x)) ELSE pi/2 ENDIF
% 
%	  acos(x:real_abs_le1):nnreal_le_pi = pi/2 - asin(x)
% 
% 
% (5) Take advantage of a new theorem about the derivative 
%     of an inverse function (derivative_inverse in analysis).
% 
% (6) Gradually expand the domain (source) of sin/cos definition from 
%     (0,pi/4), firstly upto (0,2*pi) and then onto the whole real line.
% 
% (7) After establishing the derivatives, prove the series properties using
%     Taylor's Theorem.
% 
% 
% 
% Some of David Lester's thoughts about why this is a better way to go than 
% from infinite series definitions.
% 
% (1) At the time I wasn't too happy about arguing about infinite series, 
%     and felt that basing the result on something more concrete would be 
%     more useful.
% 
% (2) I think you run into some rather nasty and subtle circular reasoning 
%     errors if you go down this route. The first problem will be to show 
%     that $|sin(x)| <= 1$. Not circular, but not nice!
% 
% (3) I've remembered: at some stage you're going to have to show that
%     (sin(x)/cos(x)) is bijective for x in the range (-pi/2,pi/2).
%     Now, you could define pi = 4*atan(1), but I think you'll run into
%     quite a few problems establishing the connections between these three 
%     infinite series.
% 
%     Not quite circular reasoning (though I've been down quite a few of 
%     those blind alleys recently!), but many of the results you think you 
%     can rely on turn out to be unavailable for this reason.
